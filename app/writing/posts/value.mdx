# What Makes an Object Valuable?

Most Americans have a lot of stuff. But what does that stuff really mean? Why does it matter?  Objects hold feelings and store bonds, they reduce stress and make life easier--tangible things are the unspoken foundations of modern life. The value of an item rests in its meaning to an individual or a group. Understanding value brings clarity to the things that matter, how they matter, and why they matter. The three ways an object can be of value are market, personal value, and utility.

The first type of value is based on market--coming from the concept of the exchange of goods for the benefit of more than one person. This must involve a mutual agreement on the value of something, or a comparison of desires--market value is based on supply and demand.  For example, precious metals or gems in general are valuable because of popular demand, and limited supply. Currency, when regulated, holds value that stands for the market of transferring goods. Market value ultimately lets people use each other’s resources for the advantage of everyone.

The next type of value is utility. This is based on what the object does for someone. One example is food, at its simplest. To a certain extent it does not matter where food comes from--it is made to serve a purpose, which is to sustain energy. Another example could be a simple pair of sunglasses. Their meaning to a certain woman is their protection from sunlight, and their trendy style. The protection of the sunglasses will help her in seeing outdoors, and the style might enhance her appearance. Utility value is all about usefulness.

The final type of value is personal  or sentimental value--an object  can invoke a feeling, symbolize a connection, or trigger a memory. This type of value can be held in any object, but in this case, what matters is not the object itself, or what it might do, but the meaning it holds within. A family heirloom is a perfect example of this type of value, symbolizing a memory, and a legacy. This type of value also can include artwork, which triggers feelings and sets the mood for a place. Objects like these help people appreciate the non-tangible things that help give deeper meaning to life.

Noticing the value of everyday things helps us appreciate them, and illuminates desires, connections, and basic needs. Useful things make life easier. Sentimental things trigger feelings. And the market gives perspective and provides mutual gains. Many valuable objects fit in more than one of these categories, even at the same time. If a possession does not fit any of the categories, it does not have value. Finding value shows how possessions shape connections with the outside world, and the meaning of objects is a vital part in the meaning of life.
